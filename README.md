# Damage-Classification-using-Satellite-Images
Classifying post damage level of buildings from satellite imagery, given pre and post-disaster satellite images and building locations
We implement and compare multiple
approaches for classifying post damage level of buildings from
satellite imagery, given pre and post-disaster satellite images
and building locations. We experiment with different feature
extraction methods and various Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) architectures. We used multiple libraries and machines
for training different models. For CNNs, we mainly used
Google Colab and Keras with TensorFlow backend. Although
Google Colab offers free and fast GPU computing, daily
time limits and difficulties in data transfer prevented us from
taking full advantage of the service. For preprocessing of the
data, feature extraction, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)
models, we used Matlab on our computers. Due to limited
memory on our systems, we used a smaller subset of the data
in such models. We use the xView2 Challenge Dataset to train
and test our models.
